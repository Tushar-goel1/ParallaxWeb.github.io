          Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the
          countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the
          eighteenth century. Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer
          but they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose
          associated with specific religions. <br />
          "Hiking" is the preferred term in Canada and the United States; the
          term "walking" is used in these regions for shorter, particularly
          urban walks. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, the
          word "walking" describes all forms of walking, whether it is a walk in
          the park or backpacking in the Alps.

        <p class="text">
          Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities
          which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of
          water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough
          water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience. This
          activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if
          not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14
          feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person
          rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at
          the stern, or by the use of oars.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use
          breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface air
          supply, and therefore has a limited but variable endurance. The
          name "scuba", an acronym for "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing
          Apparatus", was coined by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent
          submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing
          gas, usually compressed air, affording them greater independence
          and movement than surface-supplied divers, and more time underwater
          than free divers. Although the use of compressed air is common, a
          gas blend with a higher oxygen content, known as enriched air or
          nitrox, has become popular due to the reduced nitrogen intake during
          long or repetitive dives. Also, breathing gas diluted with helium may
          be used to reduce the likelihood and effects of nitrogen narcosis
          during deeper dives.
